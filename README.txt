A text style blackjack game with a fairly-functional deck class that can be shuffled, cut, and dealt

The game consists of one player and the dealer who are each initially dealt two cards.
At this point, the player can see both of his or her cards and only one of the dealer's cards.
Then the player is prompted to either hit or stay.
If the player hits, an additional card is added to the hand and he or she is prompted to hit or stay again, provided that the total hand value is <= 21.

Once content with the hand, the player can enter stay into the command prompt and then the game reveals the dealer's hand and point value.
As long as the dealer's hand is less than 17, he is required to hit.

After the bulk of this game has finished, the hands of both the player and dealer are displayed again as well as the overall point totals.
Then, the result of the game displays with either a win for the dealer, a win for the player, or a push.
